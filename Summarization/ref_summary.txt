TextRank is a graph-based extractive summarization algorithm.

overview of the TextRank algorithm.
Traditional methods for text summarization analyze the frequency of words
or sentences in the first paragraphs of the text to identify the most important
Other methods are based in the representation of the text as a graph.
graph-based ranking approaches consider the intrinsic structure of the texts in-
text (sentences or words) using variations of PageRank [20].
TextRank is an unsupervised algorithm for the automated summarization of
texts that can also be used to obtain the most important keywords in a document.
The algorithm applies a variation of PageRank [20] over a graph constructed
3.2 Text as a Graph
For the task of automated summarization, TextRank models any document as
the graph edges, the higher the similarity between sentences the more important

TextRank determines the relation of similarity between two sentences based

Given two sentences R, S, BM25 is defined as:
We found the resulting scores of the original algorithm to be identical to those

Evaluation results for the proposed TextRank variations.

the original TextRank algorithm with 1.40% total improvement.
We also contributed the BM25-TextRank algorithm to the Gensim project4
This work presented three different variations to the TextRank algorithm for au-

Based on these results we suggest the use of BM25 along with TextRank for
the task of unsupervised automatic summarization of texts.
